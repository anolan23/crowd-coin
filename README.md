[CrowdCoin](https://crowd-coin-one.vercel.app/) is a decentralized application that reads and writes smart contracts on the Ethereum Rinkby Test Network. 

It aims to fix the flaws that are inherent in the current state of Kickstarter (crowdfunding) applications.

# Prerequisites
In order to send transactions to the smart contracts you must:
- Have [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) installed.
- Have some test ether on the Rinkby Test Network. 

A popular site to obtain test ether can be found at [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
